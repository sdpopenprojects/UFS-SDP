# Impact of unsupervised feature selection techniques
This repository contains the code used in the article titled "The Impact of Unsupervised Feature Selection Techniques on the Performance and Interpretation of Defect Prediction Models."


## Prerequisites
Because some of the unsupervised feature selection algorithms used are implemented using matlab, this experiment uses these techniques by launching the Matlab engine using the 'matlab.engine' module for python. Therefore, it is necessary to install a version of the matlab product that is compatible with python and set the path in matlab.
## Repository Structure

* code
	* run.py: The main approach to running the entire python code
	*  FeatureSelection: The various feature selection methods used are called from the methods in this folder.
